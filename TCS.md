# A3 Proofs & Proof Strategies
## Statement
1. consists of a set of **preconditions** and a set of **conclusions**.
2. The statement is true if the conclusions are true whenever the preconditions are true.
3. in logic is true: If 4 is a prime number then 2·3 = 4.

## Mathematical Proof
a sequence of **logical steps** starting with one set of statements
that comes to the conlusion that some statement must be true.

1. **axioms**: statements that are assumed to always be true in the current context
2. **theorems and lemmas:** statements that were already proven 
    1. lemma: an intermediate tool
    2. theorem: itself a relevant result
3. **premises**: assumptions we make to see what consequences they have

## Direct Proof
For all sets A, B, C: A ∩(B ∪ C) = ( A ∩ B)∪ ( A ∩ C ).  

Proof.  
Alternative:  
A ∩ (B ∪ C ) = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ B ∪ C }  
= {x | x ∈ A and (x ∈ B or x ∈ C)}  
= {x | (x ∈ A and x ∈ B) or (x ∈ A and x ∈ C)} = {x | x ∈ A ∩ B or x ∈ A ∩ C }  
= (A ∩ B) ∪ ( A ∩ C )  

## Indirect Proof
Let A and B be sets. If A \ B = ∅ then A ⊆ B.  

We prove the theorem **by contradiction.**  
Assume that there are sets A and B with A \ B = ∅ and A  ̸⊆ B. Let A and B be such sets.  
Since A  ̸⊆ B there is some x ∈ A such that x ̸∈ B.  
For this x it holds that x ∈ A \ B.  
This is a contradiction to A \ B = ∅.  
We conclude that the assumption was false and thus the theorem is true.  

## Structural Induction
Proof of statement for all elements of an inductively defined set  
1. basis: proof of the statement for the **basic elements**
2. induction hypothesis (IH):
suppose that the statement is true for some elements M
3. inductive step: proof of the statement for elements constructed by applying a **construction rule **to M (one inductive step for each construction rule)

For all binary trees B: inner(B) = leaves(B) − 1.  

**Proof**  
induction basis:  
inner(□) = 0 = 1 − 1 = leaves(□) − 1  
⇝ statement is true for base case  

induction hypothesis:  
to prove that the statement is true for a composite tree ⟨L,⃝,R⟩, we may use that it is true for the subtrees L and R.  
inductive step for B = ⟨L, ⃝, R ⟩: inner(B) = inner(L) + inner(R) + 1
IH
= (leaves(L) − 1) + (leaves(R) − 1) + 1  
= leaves(L) + leaves(R) − 1 = leaves(B) − 1  

# B1. Formal Languages & Grammars
## Decision Problems: Given-Question Form
Given: possible input  
Question: does the given input have a certain property?  
## Alphabets and Formal Languages
Definition (Alphabets, Words and Formal Languages)  

An **alphabet Σ** is a finite non-empty **set** of symbols.  
A **word** over Σ is a finite **sequence** of elements from Σ.  
The **empty word** (the empty sequence of elements) is denoted by **ε**. **Σ∗** denotes the **set of all words over Σ**.  
**Σ+ (= Σ∗ \ {ε})** denotes the set of all non-empty words over Σ.  
We write **|w|** for the **length** of a word w.  
A **formal language** (over alphabet Σ) is a **subset of Σ∗**.  

## Languages: Examples
S1 = {a,aa,aaa,aaaa,...} = {a}+  
S2 = Σ∗  
S3 = {anbn | n ≥ 0} = {ε,ab,aabb,aaabbb,...}  
S4 ={ε}  
S5 = ∅  
S6 = {w ∈ Σ∗ | w contains twice as many as as bs} = {ε,aab,aba,baa,...}  

## Grammar
Variables V = {S, X, Y}   
Alphabet Σ = {a, b, c}.   
**Production rules:**
S → ε X → aX  
X → 0Y1 | XY  

A grammar is a **4-tuple ⟨V , Σ, R, S⟩** with:  
1. V finite set of **variables** (nonterminal symbols)  
2. Σ finite alphabet of **terminal symbols** with V ∩ Σ = ∅ 
3. R ⊆ **(V∪Σ)∗V(V∪Σ)∗×(V∪Σ)∗** finite set of rules 
4. S ∈ V start variable

## Derivations
Let⟨V,Σ,R,S⟩ be a grammar. A word v ∈ (V∪Σ)∗ can be **derived** from word u ∈ (V∪Σ)+ (written as u⇒v)if  
1. u=xyz,v=xy′z with x,z∈(V∪Σ)∗ and  
2. there is a rule **y → y′ ∈ R**.  
We write: u ⇒∗ v if v can be derived from u in finitely many steps (i. e., by using n derivations for n ∈ N0).

## Languages
The language generated by a grammar G = ⟨V,Σ,P,S⟩  
**L(G)={w ∈ Σ∗ |S ⇒∗ w}**  
is the **set of all words** from Σ∗ that can be derived from S with **finitely** many rule applications.

## Chomsky hierarchy
1. Every **grammar** is of type 0 (**all rules allowed**).  
2. Grammar is of type 1 (**context-sensitive**)  
3. if all rules are of the form **αBγ → αβγ**. with **B ∈ V and α,γ ∈ (V∪Σ)∗ and β ∈ (V∪Σ)+**
4. Grammar is of type 2 (**context-free**) if all rules are of the form **A → w**, where **A ∈ V and w ∈ (V ∪ Σ)+**.
5. Grammar is of type 3 (regular) if all rules are of the form A → w, where A ∈ V and w ∈ Σ ∪ Σ V .

## Type 0–3 Languages
A languageL ⊆ Σ∗ is of type0 (type1,type2,type3)  
if there exists a type-0 (type-1, type-2, type-3) **grammar G with L(G) = L.**

# Regular Grammars: ε-Rules
## Regular Grammars
A regular grammar is a **4-tuple ⟨V , Σ, R, S⟩** with
1. V finite set of **variables** (nonterminal symbols)
2. Σ finite alphabet of **terminal** symbols with V ∩ Σ = ∅
3. R ⊆ (V × (Σ ∪ ΣV)) ∪ {⟨S,ε⟩} finite set of rules
4. if S → ε ∈ R,there is no X ∈ V,y ∈ Σ with X → yS ∈ R 
5. S ∈ V start variable.

## Regular Languages
A language is regular if it is generated by some regular grammar.  
A language L ⊆ Σ∗ is regular  
if there exists a regular grammar G with **L(G ) = L**.

## R ⊆V ×(Σ∪ΣV ∪{ε})
We are going to show that every grammar with rules generates a regular language.
