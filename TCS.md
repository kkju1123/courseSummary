# A2
## Set 
key: unordered, once
type: explict and implict
explict: {1,2,3}
implict: {x|1<x<3}
cardinality: |M| = number of elements in M
subset: A⊆B
strict subset: A⊂B
power set P(M): set of all subsets of M

## Tuples
**odered** not only once sequence: (a1,a2,a3)
components: objects contained in tuples

## Cartesian Product
M1 ×···×Mn = {⟨o1,...,on⟩|o1 ∈ M1,...,on ∈ Mn}.
**n-ary relation R** over the sets M1,...,Mn = R ⊆ M1×···×Mn.

## Functions
(total) function f : D → C
maps **every** value of its domain D
to exactly **one** value of its codomain C.

partial function f : X →p Y
f does not map x ∈ X to any value in Y, then f is undefined for x.
